# *Cooking Recipe*
## ingredients
* 3/4 cup (100 grams) coarse yellow cornmeal
* 3/4 cup (100 grams) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) molasses
* 1 cup (235 ml) buttermilk, well-shaken
* 4 tablespoons (55 grams) melted unsalted butter
* 1 large egg

## kitchen tool
- waffle iron
- oven

## Recipe
1. Combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in the bottom of a medium bowl.\ In a smaller bowl, whisk molasses, butter, buttermilk and egg until combined.
2. Pour into dry ingredients and stir to combine. Let batter rest for 10 minutes
3. Use this time to place a oven-safe cooling rack over a tray and heat oven to 200 degrees. \ Heat waffle iron according to manufacturer??s instructions
4. Brush waffle iron with melted butter or coat with nonstick spray. Ladle in waffle batter, 1/4 cup at a time
5. Cook until lightly browned and carefully transfer to rack in oven.

# *Euclidean Distance*
## Definition
The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\overline {pq})$.

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = ($p_{1}$, $p_{2}$,$\dots$, $p_{n}$) and q = ($q_{1}$, $q_{2}$,$\dots$, $q_{n}$) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:
 ${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d(\mathbf {p} ,\mathbf {q} )=d(\mathbf {q} ,\mathbf {p} )&={\sqrt {(q_{1}-p_{1})^{2}+(q_{2}-p_{2})^{2}+\cdots +(q_{n}-p_{n})^{2}}}\\[8pt]&={\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(q_{i}-p_{i})^{2}}}.\end{aligned}}}$

 The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or Euclidean length, or magnitude of a vector measures the length of the vector:
${\displaystyle\|\mathbf {p} \|={\sqrt {p_{1}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}+\cdots +p_{n}^{2}}}={\sqrt {\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {p} }}} \left\|{\mathbf  {p}}\right\|={\sqrt  {p_{1}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}+\cdots +p_{n}^{2}}}={\sqrt  {{\mathbf  {p}}\cdot {\mathbf  {p}}}}$,
where the last expression involves the dot product.
